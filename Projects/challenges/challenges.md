# RUST CHALLENGES

## Welcome, Rustaceans!

### Challenge 1

Assign every lowercase letter a value, from 1 for a to 26 for z. Given a string of lowercase letters, find the sum of the values of the letters in the string.

### Challenge 2

Create a function that finds a word with a given sum in the word list provided. For instance, polytetrafluoroethylene is the only word with a sum of 313.

#### Challenge 2.1: Possible optimization 1

Assign a value to each word in the word list before read the sum, this way you can delimit your search

#### Challenge 2.2: Possible optimization 2

Read each character of the word and stops if its greater than the specified sum

### Challenge 3

How many words have an odd letter sum?

### Challenge 4

There are 1921 words with a letter sum of 100, making it the second most common letter sum. What letter sum is most common, and how many words have it?

### Challenge 5

zyzzyva and biodegradabilities have the same letter sum as each other (88), and their lengths differ by 5 letters. Find the other pair of words with the same letter sum whose lengths differ by 11 letters.

### Challenge 6

cytotoxicity and unreservedness have the same letter sum as each other (188), and they have no letters in common. Find a pair of words that have no letters in common, and that have the same letter sum, which is larger than 188. (There are two such pairs, and one word appears in both pairs.)

### Challenge 7

The list of word { geographically, eavesdropper, woodworker, oxymorons } contains 4 words. Each word in the list has both a different number of letters, and a different letter sum. The list is sorted both in descending order of word length, and ascending order of letter sum. What's the longest such list you can find?

### Challenge 8

You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the screen, using asterisk (\*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

Examples
A size 3 diamond:
` *`
`***`
` *`
`...which would appear as a string of " *\n***\n *\n"`
